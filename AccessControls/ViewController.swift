        //  Marking a class public does not necessarily imply that the I wants the class to be initialized publicly. Since Swift doesn't contain explicit support for abstract classes, the act of making a class public but without public initializers basically serves as an abstract class (except each function must still have a default definition, either in the class itself or some protocol extension). Also, If I initialize these objects in my framework. It will definelty work.

// Public - A public class is accessible but not subclassable outside of the defining module. A public class member is accessible but not overridable outside of the defining module.

// Open - An open class is accessible and subclassable outside of the defining module. An open class member is accessible and overridable outside of the defining module.
